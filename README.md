## Under the Hood

- [**Frappe Framework**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe): A full-stack web application framework written in Python and Javascript. The framework provides a robust foundation for building web applications, including a database abstraction layer, user authentication, and a REST API.

- [**Frappe UI**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui): A Vue-based UI library, to provide a modern user interface. The Frappe UI library provides a variety of components that can be used to build single-page applications on top of the Frappe Framework.

## Production Setup

### Managed Hosting

You can try [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com), a simple, user-friendly and sophisticated [open-source](https://github.com/frappe/press) platform to host Frappe applications with peace of mind.

It takes care of installation, setup, upgrades, monitoring, maintenance and support of your Frappe deployments. It is a fully featured developer platform with an ability to manage and control multiple Frappe deployments.

### Containerized Installation

Use docker to deploy ERPNext in production or for development of [Frappe](https://github.com/frappe/frappe) apps. See https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker for more details.

### Manual Install

The Easy Way: our install script for bench will install all dependencies (e.g. MariaDB). See https://github.com/frappe/bench for more details.

New passwords will be created for the ERPNext "Administrator" user, the MariaDB root user, and the frappe user (the script displays the passwords and saves them to ~/frappe_passwords.txt).


### Local

To setup the repository locally follow the steps mentioned below:

**Step 1**: Setup bench by following the [Installation Steps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation) and start the server

```
bench start
```

**Step 2**: In a separate terminal window, run the following commands:

```
# Create a new site
bench new-site erpnext.dev

# Map your site to localhost
bench --site erpnext.dev add-to-hosts
```

**Step 3**: Get the Insights app and install it

```
# Get the Insights app
bench get-app https://github.com/frappe/erpnext

# Install the app
bench --site erpnext.dev install-app erpnext
```

**Step 4**: Open the URL `http://erpnext.dev:8000/app` in your browser, you should see the app running
